i have made a webpage ilustrating the web design i am gonna make to enhance students experience better at universities.
i already have known that such portals are already existed but they are so much complex and does not give what i want as a student.
i have used javascript to get a view of what i am gong to do.
this web enables students to interact with each other irrespective of their batches, exchange tips and tricks and provde past papers as well.
it also enables student to learn from the experiences of their teachers and seniors.
i have used css and html to very basic level as i dont know much but i have learnt many amazing things.
this also enable students to disscuss exams, collge events and seminars etc.
this website also tells the students about loans and scholarships which is coming on its way.
it also suggest the best spot to enhance their experience like park, computer lab, sports complex etc.
